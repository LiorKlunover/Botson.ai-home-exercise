# Project Process Documentation

## Development Timeline

1. Created Next.js project
2. Downloaded the json file transformedFeeds.json to my computer and deployed it to MongoDB Atlas into myDatabase.db, collections named feeds 

```
mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://lior345622:JKTAas1uTa0psQgT@cluster0.zttbjsy.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority" --collection=feeds --file=transformedFeeds.json --mode=upsert --jsonArray
```

3. Created connection to MongoDB with the file mongodb.ts, and initialized connection when app loaded with instrumentation.ts file
4. Created types/index.ts file to handle types
5. Created db.ts file to handle schema and model
6. Created API routes:
   - api/GetFeeds/route.ts
   - api/GetClients/route.ts
   - api/GetCountry/route.ts

7. Created dashboard page with the following components:
   - TotalCard - Displays summary metrics and totals
   - FeedGraphCard - Visualizes feed data in graph format
   - StatusDistributionCard - Shows distribution of feed statuses
   - ProgressMetricsCard - Displays progress metrics for feeds
   - FilterPanel - Provides filtering options for dashboard data
   - SimpleDashboardWrapper - Basic layout wrapper for dashboard components
   - DashboardWrapper - Enhanced layout with additional features
   - ClientActivityCard - Shows client activity metrics
   - DataGridTable - Displays tabular data with sorting and filtering
   - MetadataQualityCard - Visualizes metadata quality metrics
   - RecordsPerFeedCard - Shows record count distribution per feed
   
8. Implemented MongoDB Chat Server
9. Added AI chat assistant functionality

## Architecture and Key Design Choices

### Overall Architecture
The project follows a modern web application architecture based on Next.js 14 with the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
   - App Router for routing
   - Server and Client Components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Chart.js for data visualization

2. **Backend**:
   - Next.js API Routes for dashboard data
   - Separate Express server (port 3001) for chat functionality
   - MongoDB Atlas for data storage

3. **Data Flow**:
   - MongoDB connection established at app initialization
   - API routes fetch and transform data for dashboard components
   - Separate chat server handles real-time messaging

### Key Design Choices

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Dashboard data handled by Next.js API routes
   - Chat functionality isolated in a separate Express server
   - Clear component structure with reusable UI elements

2. **Data Handling**:
   - MongoDB schemas defined in db.ts
   - Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
   - Server-side data transformation to minimize client-side processing

3. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Loading states for better user experience
   - Filtering capabilities for data exploration
   - Interactive charts for data visualization

4. **Chat Implementation**:
   - Separate server to handle chat functionality
   - AI response generation using Google Gemini API
   - LangGraph for conversation flow management
   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
   - Concurrent running with Next.js app

## LangGraph and Google Gemini Integration

### LangGraph Implementation
LangGraph was integrated into the chat server to create a sophisticated conversation flow management system:

1. **Graph-Based Conversation Flow**:
   - Implemented state management for multi-turn conversations
   - Created nodes for different conversation stages (greeting, query understanding, response generation)
   - Defined edges for transitions between conversation states

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Used LangGraph's built-in memory systems to maintain conversation history
   - Implemented context retention across multiple user interactions
   - Created a feedback loop for continuous conversation improvement

3. **Integration with Express Server**:
   - Wrapped LangGraph execution within Express API endpoints
   - Implemented asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
   - Created middleware for request validation and error handling

### Google Gemini Integration

1. **API Implementation**:
   - Integrated Google Gemini API for natural language understanding and generation
   - Configured API authentication and request handling
   - Implemented rate limiting and error handling for API calls

2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Developed specialized prompts for different conversation scenarios
   - Created system prompts to guide Gemini's response style and content
   - Implemented dynamic prompt construction based on conversation context

3. **Response Processing**:
   - Parsed and formatted Gemini API responses for consistent user experience
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Created response filtering for content moderation

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implemented caching for common queries
   - Optimized token usage through prompt compression
   - Created batched processing for multiple queries

## How AI Tools Were Used During the Task

1. **Code Generation**:
   - Initial project structure setup
   - MongoDB connection and schema definition
   - API route implementation
   - Dashboard component creation
   - Chat server implementation with LangGraph and Google Gemini

2. **Debugging Assistance**:
   - Fixed FeedGraphCard rendering issues
   - Resolved server connection problems
   - Debugged API route errors

3. **Knowledge Support**:
   - Best practices for Next.js with MongoDB
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Express server configuration
   - Chart.js implementation guidance
   - LangGraph architecture patterns
   - Google Gemini API integration

4. **Code Refinement**:
   - Performance optimizations
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Type safety enhancements
   - Error handling implementation

5. **Documentation**:
   - Process documentation (this file)
   - Code comments
   - README updates

6. **Development Environment**:
   - Used Windsurf as the primary development environment
   - Leveraged Windsurf's AI-assisted coding capabilities
   - Utilized Windsurf's integrated terminal and debugging tools
